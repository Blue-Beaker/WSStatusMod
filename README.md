# WSStatusMod
A mod for celeste, sending some ingame player status, like dashes, to a local websocket server.  
Then an external tool can be made, to do sth. like reflecting the status on a streamer's virtual charactor.  

For now it only sends "dash=n" to the websocket server when player's dash count is changed.
